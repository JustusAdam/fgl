The *F*unctional *G*raph *L*ibrary for Haskell
==============================================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/fgl.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/fgl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/fgl)

Originally by Martin Erwig, this library provides an inductive approach to dealing with graphs.

For more information, please read the documentation on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl).

The [original website](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/fgl/haskell) contains various papers that might help learning and understanding the approach taken by this library; however, the code might no longer match the actual implementation.
